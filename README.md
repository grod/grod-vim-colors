vim colors
========

Just a collection of my favourite colorschemes for vim.

Almost everyone is unmodified by me, and all credit goes to the authors. Some themes are converted from Textmate using [Coloration](http://github.com/sickill/coloration)

If proper credits are missing, please let me know and I'll add them asap.



The g_rand_*.vim themes are generated using [base16-vim](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16tool) by Chris Kempson
